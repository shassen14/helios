# World Spawner

Followed this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuVfA3V3DVU

Basically, I have to create two files. One for the scene and one for the mesh

Reason why is that the meshes from the regular scenes do not match well with the coordinate systems whenever bevy abstracts the meshes when creating collisions. 

TODO: write more about what the tutorial describes to do.
TODO: figure out how to add roads, water, or non-collision objects but not have collisions those textures etc.
